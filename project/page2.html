                    Pyotr Ilyich was born on April 25 (May 7), 1840 in the village of Votkinsk, Vyatka province. In 1859, P.I. Tchaikovsky graduated from the School of Law in St. Petersburg and got
                     a job at the Ministry of Justice. The future great maestro's passion for music prevailed, and he entered the music classes founded by A.G. Rubinstein, and then the conservatory
                      (1862), and graduated in 1865. In 1866, P.I. Tchaikovsky, at the invitation of N.G. Rubinstein, began teaching (on the fundamentals of musical theory and composition) 
                      at the Moscow Conservatory.

                <p>In Moscow, the bright individuality of P.I. Tchaikovsky as a composer began to be revealed, where he performed his own works with great success. In 1877, Tchaikovsky went abroad, 
                    from this period the period of frequent moves of the composer and continuous creative activity began. Tchaikovsky conducted teaching and social work, was the director of the Moscow 
                    branch of the Russian Musical Society. On tours abroad, Tchaikovsky became famous both as the composer of his numerous works and as an outstanding conductor.

                    Among the numerous works by P.I. Tchaikovsky, the following are especially worth noting: the sixth symphony, operas (Eugene Onegin, The Maid of Orleans, Mazepa, The Enchantress, 
                    The Queen of Spades, Iolanta) and ballets (Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcracker) and many others. The great composer's work shows a slight influence of Russian stylized 
                    folklore, German composers (Weber, Schubert, Schumann), as well as Italian romantic opera composers (Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini). During his lifetime, the composer earned great
                     respect and love in Russia and abroad, his concerts were extremely popular among all segments of the population.

                <p>In 1877, having experienced a severe mental crisis, Tchaikovsky left the conservatory and went abroad, living mainly in Switzerland and Italy. At this time, material support and 
                    correspondence with the patron and music lover Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck were of no small importance to the composer. During these years, Pyotr Ilyich created the 4th Symphony 
                    and the opera Eugene Onegin, which premiered in Moscow in March 1879. In 1884, Tchaikovsky was awarded the M. I. Glinka Prize for the fantasy overture Romeo and Juliet.</p>
                    <p>From 1885 Pyotr Ilyich lived and worked in the vicinity of Klin in the village of Maidanovo, Frolovskoye, and from 1892 he settled in Klin itself. From the late 1880s he
                        performed frequently as a conductor in Russia and abroad; he gave a series of concerts in Leipzig, Hamburg, Berlin, Prague, Paris, and London, conducting his own works. 
                        In 1891 he traveled with concerts to the USA. In 1892 Pyotr Ilyich was elected a corresponding member of the Paris Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1893 – an honorary doctorate 
                        of Cambridge University.</p>
                        <p>In the late 1880s and early 1890s, Tchaikovsky created a number of his greatest works that became world classics, including the operas The Enchantress, The Queen of Spades, 
                            Iolanta, the ballets The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, the 5th and 6th Pathétique symphonies, the Manfred symphony, the Hamlet overture-fantasy, the Mozartiana suite
