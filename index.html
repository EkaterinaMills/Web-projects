          <strong>Mount Elbrus</strong> is the highest peak in both Russia and Europe, rising to an impressive 5,642 meters 
          (18,510 feet). It is located in the western Caucasus Mountains and is a dormant volcano, whose last eruption was 
          around 2,000 years ago.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Elbrus belongs to the Greater Caucasus range and is often recognized as Europe’s highest point, making it one of the 
          prestigious "Seven Summits." Its twin summits are snow-covered year-round and surrounded by massive glaciers.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Despite being a non-technical climb via the southern route, Mount Elbrus poses challenges due to its high altitude, 
          weather conditions, and glacial terrain. Most climbers rely on guided tours and acclimatization plans to safely reach 
          the summit.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Culturally, the mountain has been revered by local peoples like the Karachays and Balkars, and it features prominently 
          in ancient folklore. It remains a powerful symbol of endurance and national pride in Russia today.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The southern route features cable cars and mountain huts, while the more rugged northern route appeals to seasoned 
          alpinists. The surrounding Elbrus region offers hiking, skiing, and rich cultural experiences year-round.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Prielbrusye National Park protects much of the area and is home to alpine flora and fauna, traditional mountain villages, 
          and beautiful valleys and rivers that draw photographers and explorers alike.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Although it’s climbable by fit amateurs, Mount Elbrus demands respect: weather changes quickly, crevasses are present, 
          and altitude sickness is a serious concern. Preparation and proper gear are essential.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Whether admired from afar or climbed to its snow-covered peaks, Mount Elbrus continues to inspire adventurers and 
          travelers as a symbol of natural beauty and challenge.
